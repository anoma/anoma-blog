We are thrilled to announce the completion of the 3rd round for [Anoma](https://anoma.net/) – raising a total of USD 25M. The round was co-led by returning fund CMCC Global and included the participation of Electric Capital, who has supported all rounds so far.

> "We are thrilled to be co-leading this fundraising round of Anoma. The team is pushing the boundaries of protocol design and reimagining how base layer infrastructure should operate. It is refreshing to see Anoma’s designs and philosophy against the backdrop of a homogenous group of layer 1 smart contract platforms." – **\*Charlie Morris**, Co-founder and Managing Partner at **CMCC Global\***

We welcome many new backers into the ecosystem including: Delphi Digital, Dialectic, KR1, Spartan, NGC, MH Ventures, Bixin Ventures, No Limit, WAGMI, Plassa, Perridon Ventures, Anagram, and Factor, as well as more than 30 angels of diverse backgrounds, from founders of L1s and dApps to ZK cryptographers and systems designers.

> "We at Delphi Ventures are thrilled to support Anoma in its quest to fundamentally alter the way we interact within permissionless systems. We believe that Anoma's vision aligns perfectly with the principles of Crypto, fostering a decentralized and user-centric internet. Anoma's intent-centric architecture represents a significant advancement across all fronts of blockchain infrastructure including scalability, UX, privacy and interoperability. We are excited to be part of their journey towards revolutionizing decentralized applications." – **Tommy Shaughnessy**, Founding Partner of **Delphi Digital**

The Anoma Foundation completed two fundraising rounds in 2020 and 2021 respectively, both led by Polychain Capital, with the participation of funds including Coinbase Ventures, P2P Capital, Figment, ZKV, Maven 11, Chorus One, Lemniscap, CMS, Wicklow Capital, Informal Systems, and the Interchain Foundation.

Anoma is the first ever intent-centric architecture, introducing a new paradigm for building infrastructure layers and a new operating system for decentralized applications. Anoma’s intent-centricity introduces novel primitives that allow existing web2.5 dApps to be fully decentralized, such as optimistic and ZK rollups, DEXs, NFT marketplaces, or public goods funding applications like Gitcoin.

> "We’re super excited to be investing into Anoma. Their intent-centricity and inherent focus on low-level privacy promises to unlock novel use-cases, particularly in areas such as next-generation DeFi, and represents a major step forward for the space." – **\*Ryan Zurrer**, Founder of Dialectic\*

On a meta level, Anoma’s architecture is designed from the ground up for applications that involve infinite users, issuing infinite numbers of intents, each of arbitrary complexity. Anoma makes it straightforward to build novel applications that are otherwise clunky, limited or impossible to build on existing architectures including Ethereum (EVM) and Ethereum-like protocols. Example novel applications include runtime rollups, multiparty, multivariate bartering, DeFi dApps such as sealed-bid second price auctions, privacy-preserving DAOs, and new age / Game B economic systems such as [plural money](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-money/), [Collaborative Finance](https://cofi.informal.systems/), and [Heterotopia](https://pluranimity.org/2022/09/26/towards-heterotopia/).

Similar to when Ethereum was first introduced in a world of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-like architectures-only, our journey so far has been full of challenges. After more than 2 years of building Anoma and the ecosystem, it is incredibly heartening to see that the rest of the space is starting to get excited about the concept of intents and seeing Anoma’s architecture in production.

The marathon continues apace, as we’re getting ready for Namada’s mainnet launch in the next months – and continuing to build the Anoma protocol and its entire stack, including [Taiga](https://github.com/anoma/taiga), [Typhon](https://github.com/anoma/typhon), [Vamp-ir](https://github.com/anoma/vamp-ir), and [Juvix](https://github.com/anoma/juvix). On the Anoma front, we’re getting ready for a first public testnet with example dApps and developer tools, which will enable the very first developers to build the first applications in this intent-centric and declarative paradigm.

A big thank you to all backers, partners, and teams in the ecosystem who have supported us so far and to the team at Heliax for all the hard work so far – and thank you to the new partners for boldly supporting a radically novel architecture and category creator.

We couldn’t do it without you!
